      <description>In this post, I want to revisit Score Samping Distillation (SDS) for 3D head synthesis. Having recently found this paper, I discovered several ideas on how to properly generate textures with SDS. In my previous post on this topic I was mentioning that it was particularly complicated to generate clean face textures.
Figure 1: Image from the paper: faceg2e pipeline
Geometry phase First thing to notice is that the pipeline is split into two parts: geometry generation and then texture generation.</description>

      <description>Morphable models One of the easiest and common approaches to face shape reconstruction are 3D morphable models (3DMM). For example, the FLAME head model is used left and right in research papers. Among recent works making use of 3DMM that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, HRN demonstrates quite impressive results.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to discuss in depth 3DMMs, how they work or how they&amp;rsquo;re built. Let&amp;rsquo;s just mention that with this approach, a 3D shape is reconstructed as a linear combination of basis components.</description>
