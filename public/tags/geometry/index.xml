      <description>I recently encountered a problem working with 3D avatars: having a custom-generated head mesh, I needed to merge it seamlessly with the avatar&amp;rsquo;s body. And since you can&amp;rsquo;t go around asking 3D artists to do their magic all the time, here I suggest a simple solution for this type of problem.

To tackle this, one can make use of Blender&amp;rsquo;s proportional editing, and as it turns out, it works pretty well.</description>

      <title>Text-Guided 3D Face Synthesis: Paper Break-Down</title>

      <description>In this post, I want to revisit Score Samping Distillation (SDS) for 3D head synthesis. Having recently found this paper, I discovered several ideas on how to properly generate textures with SDS. In my previous post on this topic I was mentioning that it was particularly complicated to generate clean face textures.

Geometry phase First thing to notice is that the pipeline is split into two parts: geometry generation and then texture generation.</description>

      <title>Using Stable Diffusion To Tune 3D Morphable Model</title>

      <description>Morphable models One of the easiest and common approaches to face shape reconstruction are 3D morphable models (3DMM). For example, the FLAME head model is used left and right in research papers. Among recent works making use of 3DMM that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, HRN demonstrates quite impressive results.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to discuss in depth 3DMMs, how they work or how they&amp;rsquo;re built. Let&amp;rsquo;s just mention that with this approach, a 3D shape is reconstructed as a linear combination of basis components.</description>
