      "Aligning mesh textures with different topologies could be a fantastic feature for any 3D project. This would unlock numerous possibilities, such as texture transfer or novel texture generation. That’s precisely what the AUV-Net paper by Nvidia addresses. Let’s review the paper to understand its primary concepts."}
