      "I want to revisit Score Samping Distillation (SDS) for 3D head synthesis. Having recently found paper about it, I discovered several ideas on how to properly generate textures with SDS. In my previous post on this topic I was mentioning that it was particularly complicated to generate clean face textures."},

      "Aligning mesh textures with different topologies could be a fantastic feature for any 3D project. This would unlock numerous possibilities, such as texture transfer or novel texture generation. That’s precisely what the AUV-Net paper by Nvidia addresses. Let’s review the paper to understand its primary concepts."}
