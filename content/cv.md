### EXPERIENCE

#### **Research Engineer, [ReadyPlayerMe](https://readyplayer.me/)**  (2021 - Present)
Improving visual quality and recognisability of 3D avatars.
- Developed and deployed a custom mesh [auto-morphing algorithm](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7233790639031648256/), now used by 3D artists and developers to adapt custom 3D assets and characters to RPM platform.
- Contributed to the development of a custom DL pipeline for mesh texturing, with the resulting research [published](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3610542.3626152) and presented at SIGGRAPH Asia 2023.
- Ongoing work includes experiments with face attribute prediction, 3D face reconstruction, automated face animation, and body pose estimation.

#### **Data Scientist, Sberbank** (2019 - 2021)
Worked in a small R&D team at Sber-Devices, developing and delivering a gesture recognition and hand tracking system for [SberPortal](https://babich.biz/sber-devices/) (smart device).
- Developed a multi-object hand detection and tracking system using a CNN-based approach, optimized for deployment on SberPortal.
- Contributed to the development of a gesture recognition algorithm.

#### **Data Scientist, Sberbank-Technology** (2017 - 2019)
Initial development of a smart device at Sberbank. Conducted research on deep learning methods for hand screen-control, resulting in a prototype and initiating a gesture recognition thread at the soon-to-be Sber-Devices.
- Developed a prototype for hand-tracking based on hand key-point detection that started the gesture recognition research thread in my department.
- Designed and developed SDK for voice assistant skills. Also designed its NLU and NLG parts, such as Intent Recognizer, and developed multiple core skills like Timer, Wiki, and Weather skills.
- Adapted an Adversarial Vocoder for on-device speech generation, allowing the service to function offline without relying on Google services.

#### **Junior Software Engineer, MIPT**  (2015 - 2017)
Student job at the Department of Applied Mechanics at MIPT.
- Significantly stabilized a metric for a pattern recognition project in point-like images by bringing in statistical analysis.
- Updated the laboratory technique for structural robustness tests carried out by students at MIPT. Replaced analog sensors with GUI displaying sensor data in real-time.
